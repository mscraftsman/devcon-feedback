  <meta content="After the success of previous years the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community (MSCC) is organising the fourth edition of the Developers Conference in partnership with a number of local and international companies. Although the MSCC was founded back in 2013 it quickly became clear that our tropical island has a certain lack of informational and technical events. During some monthly meetups we spoke about this situation and that it would be very interesting and delightful to organise such an event."
